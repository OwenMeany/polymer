WORK IN PROGRESS

Molecular dynamics with Brungerâ€“Brooks-Karplus integrator for a single polymer in a 3D harmonic potential well with FENE-LJ polymer model with Langevin dynamics. 

Random walk initialization of the polymer.

Deterministic Velocity Verlet integrator is available but works poorly for the non-linear polymer.
